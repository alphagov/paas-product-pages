+ Our status page ‘subscribe to updates’ link does not contain programmatically discernible link text. This fails WCAG 2.1A 1.3.1 success criterion (Info and Relationships).

+ Our status page subscribe to updates forms do not indicate to users that they are expandable or collapsible. This fails WCAG 2.1A 4.1.2 success criterion (Name, Role, Value).

+ Our status page subscribe to updates forms, when submitted with incorrect data, do not inform screen reader users of the error message when it becomes available. This fails WCAG 2.1AA 4.1.3 success criterion (Status Messages).
