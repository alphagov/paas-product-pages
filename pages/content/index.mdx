# GOV.UK PaaS is being decommissioned

Following an options analysis, GDS has decided to decommission GOV.UK PaaS.

Thanks to all tenants who have used our platform over the years.

## The decision

[You can read more about the decision on our blog post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/).

## Migration guidance

Read about how to prepare to migrate to another platform in our [migration guidance](migration-guidance)

## Our service

We will continue to run a secure and reliable platform as we always have.

We aim to maintain our 99.95% availability target and to [support](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/support-and-response-times) continued operations on the platform until it is decommissioned.

Due to the variety of GOV.UK PaaS tenants, it is unlikely that we will be able to provide off-the-shelf solutions. 

We will facilitate and strongly encourage communications and knowledge sharing between tenants.

As we gain a more complete picture of our tenants’ migration needs, the team will work to enable solutions and may contribute where appropriate.

## Trial accounts

We are no longer accepting new trial accounts. 

We will not be offering the option to upgrade trial accounts to billable accounts.

## Controlled decommissioning

The decommissioning of GOV.UK PaaS has a target retirement date of  December 2023. The final date will be determined by our tenants’ migration plans.

We’re speaking to tenants to work out how best we can support migration to alternative hosting providers.
