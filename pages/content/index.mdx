## Save time and money

Using GOV.UK PaaS can save you time and money because:

- you do not need to build your own infrastructure or platform
- you do not need to employ infrastructure engineers to maintain the platform
- information assurance is easier because the platform is already assured by the Cabinet Office
- procurement is easier with a memorandum of understanding
- cloud resource costs are lower than they would be for smaller contracts
