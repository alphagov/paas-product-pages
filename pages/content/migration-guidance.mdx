# Migrating from GOV.UK PaaS

## Last updated

## Government cloud hosting strategy

The Government Digital Service (GDS) has provided GOV.UK PaaS since 2015, supporting and providing a public cloud platform for departments using a shared hosting and responsibility model. 

Following an extensive analysis period, GDS has concluded that, while the platform has been successful in its aims, the underlying technology would now require investment before it could meet its goals in the long term. 

Faced with this need for re-investment GDS has decided to [decommission the platform](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/), in order to focus its budget and energy on other GDS products for common use by Government.

GDS will not be providing a replacement hosting service.

Tenants should look to their own department, or parent department, and use existing support for public cloud hosting services. 

In deciding where to host their service next, tenants should consider the following principles from the [Central Digital & Data Office (CDDO)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office/about#responsibilities):

- Tenants should continue to use public cloud services, or internal platforms based on public cloud offerings. These continue to be the platforms of choice for government services.
- The [Central Digital & Data Office (CDDO)](https://cddo.blog.gov.uk/) has secured Director General level agreement to help share services. Larger departments are prepared to share knowledge, patterns and platforms with the rest of government. If tenants have no existing cloud engineering capability, you could [approach the CDDO](mailto:cddo-cloud-programme-service-desk@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to benefit from the sharing agreements.
- When selecting a cloud platform, the tenant should assure themselves that:
  - the public sector cloud supplier is regionally appropriate, i.e. that the data will reside in locations suitable for your workload; with GOV.UK PaaS this was predominantly the AWS eu-west-2 (London) region, but some tenancies were hosted in the AWS eu-west-1 (Ireland) region
  - billing processes are clearly defined and understood
  - any ‘service wrap’ provided by the department or supplier is appropriate and proportionate to the needs of your application
  - you have suitable arrangements in place for retention or archiving of data and its safe transit through migration
- they understand and are prepared to manage and accept any risks of using the new platform and security assurance is carried out before the new service transition date

## Introduction

### The purpose of this guidance

To help GOV.UK PaaS tenants plan to move their services to an alternative hosting platform by 23 December 2023 and understand how the GOV.UK PaaS team can assist in the migration.

### What does this mean for my service?

By 23 December 2023 all services hosted on GOV.UK PaaS will need to have migrated to an alternate hosting platform.

Any services that are not hosted on another platform by that date will go offline. 

All platform and tenant data will be permanently deleted by 28 February 2024. 

If you miss the deadline, and you need to migrate your applications, contact us via [the normal support routes](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/support). If you contact us before we have deleted all tenant data, we will be able to provide this data. We will not be able to provide access to the applications or their configuration on GOV.UK PaaS.

### Key dates

These are some key dates in the lifetime of the platform until decommission.

### Support for GOV.UK PaaS

GDS will continue to provide a team of site reliability engineers to perform critical platform operations and [timely support](https://team-manual.cloud.service.gov.uk/incident_management/support_manual/)

The GOV.UK PaaS platform will be maintained to the usual standards until the 23 December 2023.

</table>

Unless you no longer require your service, it must be migrated before this date.

You will receive regular communications from the GOV.UK PaaS team via email.

We offer help and advice though our usual channels:

- [GOV.UK PaaS Team (support form)](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/support/contact-us) for platform tenants who have questions about migration.
- [cross government slack #govuk-paas](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C33SAH4GJ) channel for tenants using the [cross government slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com)
- GDS slack [#paas](https://gds.slack.com/archives/CADHV9267) channel for internal users


### Changing responsibility model

GOV.UK PaaS is designed and built with a [shared responsibility model](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/responsibility_model.html#know-your-responsibilities). After migration, tenants will assume the responsibilities that the GOV.UK PaaS team once owned for their own infrastructure. 

Examples include:

- [Security information and event management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_event_manager) (SIEM) threat detection compliance and security incident management
- Information assurance and IT Health checks
- Infrastructure scaling
- Infrastructure cost management
- Infrastructure-level log management and retention
- User management
- Ingress traffic routing
- Egress traffic routing
- TLS certificates management
- Secrets management
- Platform/Operating system stack upgrades -> Upgrade deployment strategy
- Platform monitoring and alerting
- Tenant service monitoring and alerting
- Back-up management
- Disaster recovery
- Securing SSH access to applications

## Prepare to migrate

Before tenants migrate their services, there are a number of things to consider.

### Audit your services

Understand all the services that you need to migrate. You could consider:

- The relative importance of your services: which ones are higher priority? Should any be retired instead of migrated?
- The technical effort required to migrate each service to another platform
- Who owns the service? Smaller services may not have an obvious owner due to changes in the team or department structure
- The “7 Rs” are commonly used [cloud migration strategies](https://medium.com/@m.arunkumar1983/what-is-7-rs-8d9effbc607e)

### Think about your timing and budget

- Do you have the budget to fund the migration?
- Can you raise a business case for the year 2023/2024?
- What is the timeframe for your migration?
- Are there any events or features that may constraint your migration plan? For example if your service has a - higher number of users in April, you may decide to migrate a month after when it will have less of an impact
- Can you identify a sequence to migrate the services if you have more than one?
- You’ll need to explain to stakeholders that any data migration will incur some downtime. You can avoid this if absolutely necessary (see the Data migration section below)

### Review your skills

- Do you have the skills to migrate your services available in your department? You will need: 
  - people with the skills to work with the infrastructure (defined in the DDAT framework as an [infrastructure devops engineer](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/development-operations-devops-engineer) role and also referred to as [Site Reliability Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) in the wider technology marketplace), to enable the migration, change your pipelines
  - people with the skills to refactor your applications to accommodate the new hosting arrangement (i.e. software developers)
- Do you need to outsource to a delivery partner?
- Do you need to bring in contractors to supplement your team?
- Do you need to procure [cloud migration expertise from the Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/search?q=cloud%20migration) to assist with the migration?


### Consider your department’s cloud hosting strategy

- Understand your department's hosting standards and preferred cloud provider
- Determine if there is a departmental strategy to follow
- Determine if there is a departmental hosting platform available in-house. Some departments may have multiple hosting platforms for different types of workload. (for example one platform for general purpose web - hosting for OFFICIAL level services and one for data heavy workloads for data scientists)

### Assess your security needs

You will need to review the [threat model](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/building-a-security-operations-centre/onboarding-systems-and-log-sources/threat-modelling) of your service and re-assess your risks so that they can be accepted by your [senior responsible owner (SRO)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-role-of-the-senior-responsible-owner/the-role-of-the-senior-responsible-owner#key-project-leadership-roles)

## Decide where to host your services

There are many possible hosting options, but not all of them will necessarily make sense for your service. You should plan to spend time and effort exploring options and evaluating technical solutions according to your specific needs. 

You should prefer known technologies with a proven track record like your public cloud provider’s virtual machines or basic container hosting offerings.

You should consider services with higher levels of abstraction than Public Cloud IaaS, such as:

- AWS Copilot (to provision ECS)
- AWS ECS on Fargate
- AWS Lambda
- Google App Engine 
- Google Cloud Run
- Heroku 
- Microsoft Azure App Service

These are just some examples rather than endorsements so ensure that whatever you choose meets the needs of your service.

When making your technology choices, consider not only what is suitable for your team and department, but also what is suitable for each service in turn; not all services will be best placed running on the same technology. 

For example, a static website for documentation could easily be hosted on GitHub Pages, or in an AWS S3 bucket with AWS CloudFront in front; but a complex set of microservices with multiple persistent stores would be better on ECS on Fargate, or even Kubernetes if your team/department has the necessary skills to run it.

### Approach

- Keep it simple
- Find the largest building blocks you can and consider solutions that take care of the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on the specifics of your service 
- Use mature, well documented technologies and that you can readily get skills for in the marketplace
- Consider running some technical spikes to evaluate alternatives and to inform your decision

## Ongoing support for your service

Once your service is migrated to a new hosting platform you will need to look after it on an ongoing basis for a long time, potentially many years

- How is your team going to support your service over the longer term? Will there be a long lived team?
- Do you need and can you afford to offer out of hours support, including cyber security?
- Consider how you are going to support debugging of your applications (GOV.UK PaaS permits [direct SSH access to containers](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/managing_apps.html) but other hosting providers may not)
- Consider how you are going to secure an engineer’s access to backing services to allow you to support your service 
- Consider how you are going to patch container vulnerabilities in a timely manner

## Data migration

Data migration may involve downtime. If you need zero downtime it will not be easy or cheap

### Use documented PaaS data techniques

Our [technical documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/) covers a number of topics relevant for migrating services.

These documented processes are self-service and can be performed by tenants independent of the GOV.UK PaaS team.

The documentation is mature and tested and allows you to coordinate any system downtime yourselves.

#### Connecting to GOV.UK PaaS backing services

Some GOV.UK PaaS backing services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, InfluxDB, OpenSearch and Redis) only accept connections from GOV.UK PaaS apps. You’ll need to connect through a GOV.UK PaaS app to access one of these backing services from your local machine. 

[Conduit](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/guidance.html#using-the-conduit-plugin) lets you connect to your remote backing service instances from your local system. This allows you to use the standard tool for your backing service, for example, psql for PostgreSQL or mysql for MySQL CLI tools to make backups and interrogate your backing services.

- [Conduit plugin](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/guidance.html#using-the-conduit-plugin)
- [Using Conduit to dump a Postgres database on GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#paas-to-paas)
- [Using Conduit to dump a MySQL database on GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/mysql/#paas-to-paas) 

#### InfluxDB times series data

- [backup using InfluxDB backup utility](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/backup_and_restore/#backup-formats)
- [restore using InfluxDB restore utility](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/backup_and_restore/#restore-data)

Time series data is often scrapped during migration.

#### MySQL relational data

- [backup using mysqldump](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/mysql/#non-paas-to-paas)
- [restore using mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-backup-excerpt/8.0/en/reloading-sql-format-dumps.html)

#### OpenSearch non-relational data

OpenSearch is not intended as a persistent data store, and we don’t recommend moving the data you store in it. You should instead rebuild your indices at the destination. 

- [Taking and restoring snapshots in OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/1.2/opensearch/snapshot-restore/)

#### PostgreSQL relational data

- [backup using pg_dump](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#paas-to-paas)
- [restore using pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html)

#### Redis cache data

Redis is not intended as a persistent data store, and we don’t recommend moving the data you store in it. You should instead rebuild your indices at the destination. If you have been using Redis for persistent data, you will need to move it. 

- [GOV.UK PaaS Redis documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/redis/)

#### S3 file storage

- [GOV.UK PaaS - S3 documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/s3/)
- [backup using aws s3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html)
- [restore using aws s3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html)
- [Connect to an S3 bucket from outside of the GOV.UK PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/s3/#connect-to-an-s3-bucket-from-outside-of-the-gov-uk-paas)

### Consider your data migration strategy options

- Can you reduce the volume of data to migrate by archiving legacy data?
- Can you reduce the volume data to migrate during the production migration by only synchronising changes?
- Can you migrate your data ahead of your applications?

### Do you have more complex data migration needs?

Some tenants may face data migration challenges using the documented approaches above.

Things that may affect the decision include:

- the complexity of your data schema
- the need for high availability 
- the difficulty of exporting a database dump owing to a variety of factors like size of data, connection speed, or the reliability of the connection 

We recommend you make a small number of attempts to export a dump of your databases using [conduit](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/guidance.html#using-the-conduit-plugin) in order to assess how reliably you can do it.

If you think that your service will face issues migrating data using the documented approaches you should [get in contact with the team](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/support/contact-us) using our support form to discuss your needs further. 

## PaaS CDN Migration

If you are migrating from a Cloud Foundry CDN route, be aware that this is implemented as an AWS Cloudfront distribution behind the scenes.

This can create an issue if you are migrating to a different Cloudfront distribution. You will receive a 'CNAMEAlreadyExists' error if you try to set up the new Cloudfront distribution before the DNS cutover.

AWS documents (how to resolve a CNameAlreadyExists error)[https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resolve-cnamealreadyexists-error/] in their documentation.

This means you will need to remove the domain from your cdn-route service in Cloud Foundry before you can add it to your new AWS Cloudfront distribution.

This can be acheived in Cloud Foundry by removing the cdn-route service. E.g.

```
cf delete-service my-cdn-route
```

or by updating the service and removing the domain you are trying to cutover (if you have multiple domains):

```
cf update-service my-cdn-route -c '{"domain": "<remaining domains>"}'
```

This can create downtime for your application.

In order to avoid downtime you would need to cutover your domain to something other than Cloudfront for a short time or use the wildcard approach mentioned on the link above.

## Changes to your service when migrating

You will have to make some changes to the source code of your service, its supporting stack and pipelines to allow it to migrate to an alternative hosting provider.

Apps hosted on the GOV.UK PaaS need to follow [12 factor principles](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles) which is an established cloud best-practice that will help moving containers to another platform.

If you are using [GOV.UK PaaS buildpacks](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_apps.html#buildpacks) you will have to find an alternative to create your containers.  [Cloud Native buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) or [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) are some examples but other solutions are available.

You will have to provision a container registry for your container images. Our tenants currently use [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), [ACR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry/), [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry), [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry), or [Quay.io](https://quay.io/), but other solutions are available.

You will need to update your pipelines to build your containers and target your chosen hosting platform. Our tenants use all of the commonly available cicd tools including Jenkins, Concourse, GitHub actions, CircleCI. 

You may want to consider modifying your pipelines to deploy to the new hosting platform in parallel to the existing GOV.UK PaaS platform, so that you can develop and maintain their existing system whilst exploring their new hosting platform.

GOV.UK PaaS apps get credentials for their databases from the [VCAP_SERVICES](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/application-binding.html) environment variable, you will need to refactor your application to solve this problem without using the Cloud Foundry conventions or you will have to implement the environment variable mapping in your platform outside of the application code.

You will need to find other means to bring your own domains to use with your applications and generate TLS certificates. GOV.UK PaaS makes use of AWS CloudFront and ACM.

PaaS uses [log drains](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management.html) to ship logs to a permanent log service for analysis and storage. You will have to find an alternative way to do this. Using a self managed ELK stack, Logit.io and Papertrail are some examples used by our tenants but other solutions are available.

You will need to reconfigure your uptime monitoring to monitor your application. Tenants are currently using tools such as pingdom and cronitor. 

You will need to find other means to implement your preferred observability tools to collect metrics and raise alerts to support staff. Tenants are using tools such as prometheus, alertmanager, grafana, sentry pagerduty.
