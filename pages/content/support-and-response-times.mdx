GOV.UK PaaS is supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by the team that builds it. Our [responsibility model](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/responsibility_model.html) details the areas we cover.

You can email us for support at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

From Monday to Friday, between 9 and 5 and excluding bank holidays ('in hours' support), our response times (see below) range from 20 minutes to 1 business day depending on:

-   the nature of the request - we prioritise issues over queries
-   the severity of the issue
-   whether it affects a live service
-   whether it was raised during or outside of working hours

Between 5pm and 9am on Monday to Friday, at weekends and during bank holidays ('out of hours' support) we provide emergency support for critical incidents affecting live production services.

Tenants with services in production can contact us to [notify and escalate about a critical issue out of working hours](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/support).

## Response times for services in production

We address incidents, issues and requests within the timeframes detailed below:
