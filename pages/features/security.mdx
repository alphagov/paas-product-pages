## Our safety measures

The platform is designed to meet both the [Cloud Security Principles](/cloud-security-principles) and the common security needs of data classified as 'OFFICIAL':

-   data in transit is protected by HTTPS from the client to the platform
-   apps communicate with each other through private LANs using [Silk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk). Silk uses [VXLAN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348) to address private virtual network address spaces. Cloud Foundry network policies use [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) to stop unwanted communication between apps.
-   connections from your application to backing services require TLS
-   we host on Amazon Web Services (AWS) - their physical security procedures are [robust and audited](http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CESG_UK_Cloud_Security_Principles.pdf)
-   data in backing services can be encrypted at rest
-   separation between users of the platform is enforced by Cloud Foundry's internal authentication and access control system
-   Linux containers provide the boundary between running application instances
-   the platform relies on robust operational security and processes (see below)
-   it's possible to change and revoke your team members' permissions and roles to manage the service
-   users can authenticate via single sign-on with your organisation's Google and Microsoft accounts
-   we use 2-factor authentication, short-lived credentials and IP restriction policies for identity and access management to protect AWS resources
-   shared credentials are rotated to minimise risk of unauthorised access
-   Amazon Cloudtrail audits and monitors AWS activity
-   the CloudFoundry events API provides audit information about the use of your service

## How we manage change, vulnerabilities and incidents

The platform is built and maintained by a government team within the Government Digital Service, and these are the established working practices:

-   everyone with production access has Security Check (SC) clearance
-   code changes are approved by team members who haven't worked on the feature
-   we do pair programming whenever possible
-   system configuration and access privileges are under source code control and so is documentation
-   control changes to the production platform are overseen by civil servants
-   we code in the open and our code is available in the [alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov) project on GitHub - search for the 'paas' repositories
-   we have a tried and tested incident management approach
-   reports of incidents are published and available on our [status page](https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/history)
-   external penetration tests (IT Health Checks) of the platform are carried out annually and it's our policy to address all issues discovered with a CVSS score of medium or above
-   when security updates become available, we start working on them within one working day, prioritising fixes to critical severity vulnerabilities
