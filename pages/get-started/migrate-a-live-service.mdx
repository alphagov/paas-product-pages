Any migration typically involves switching costs. In the case of GOV.UK PaaS you should consider:

-   the features we offer and the [languages and frameworks](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/before_you_start.html#before-you-start) we currently support
-   the releases planned in our [roadmap](/roadmap) - bear in mind that we are always looking for private beta partners for new features
-   any work involved in making your applications follow the [12-factor app principles](https://12factor.net/)
-   the effort required to separate a monolithic service into components

Consider also the risks: some issues might only be visible when using production-scale data. We can mitigate that risk by granting short-term access to paid services, but tenants should be careful when using production data.

You should also evaluate the platform features with our 3-month trial period. If you think that GOV.UK PaaS could be an option for your service, get in contact with [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
