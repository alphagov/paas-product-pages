## Save your team time and money

By using GOV.UK PaaS you may save money by:

-   avoiding the upfront costs of being forced to build or procure your own infrastructure or platform
-   avoiding daily maintenance costs from needing to employ infrastructure engineers to keep services securely patched, up to date and running efficiently
-   needing less information assurance because the platform is consistent and assured by Cabinet Office
-   speeding up and simplifying procurement using our memorandum of understanding
-   lowering annual cloud resource costs for teams that would otherwise procure smaller contracts with higher costs
