title: "What is Platform as a Service"
---

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a hosting environment in the cloud. It separates hosting technology from your applications and services.

On PaaS you can build, develop and maintain your applications and services without having to own or manage the platform infrastructure. 

PaaS is usually run by someone else who takes care of security, updates technology and manages any licences. In most cases PaaS provides an infrastructure thatâ€™s ready to use immediately.

Using PaaS frees you from lengthy procurement processes, high costs, locked-in contracts and needing specialists on your team to manage the infrastructure.

## How PaaS is different from IaaS and SaaS

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an online service that provides computing, storage and server resources in the cloud and delivers them to your organisation through virtual machines.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a way to deliver applications on demand, like a subscription service. A bit like PaaS, a SaaS provider will manage and host your services and applications as well as the infrastructure on a cloud platform.


## Using PaaS in the public sector

If you work in the public sector, you can use GOV.UK Platform as a Service (or GOV.UK PaaS) to host your services without having to procure or build a platform yourself.

GOV.UK PaaS is built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). It is designed and built to meet user needs in government and the public sector.

It makes it easier for services teams and delivery partners to build, manage and deploy services and applications without worrying about infrastructure or maintenance.
